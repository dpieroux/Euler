The programs 0137 and 0137b are much too slow to solve the problem.

However, they give the first term of the series:

        1: 2
        2: 15
        3: 104
        4: 714
        5: 4895
        6: 33552
        7: 229970
        8: 1576239
        9: 10803704
        10: 74049690

Typing these numbers in google points us to A081018: 0, 2, 15, 104, 714, 4895,
33552, 229970, 1576239, 10803704, 74049690, 507544127, 3478759200, 23843770274,
163427632719, 1120149658760, 7677619978602, 52623190191455, 360684711361584,
2472169789339634, 16944503814015855, 116139356908771352, 796030994547383610,...

It is also Fibonacci(2n)*Fibonacci(2n+1).

The solution is thus: 1120149658760
