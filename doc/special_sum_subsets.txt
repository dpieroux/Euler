Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:

    S(B) /= S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.             (C1)
    If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).                (C2)

For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not α special sum set because
65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139,
158} satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair combinations and S(A) =
1286.

Using sets.txt, a 4K text file with one-hundred sets containing seven to twelve
elements (the two examples given above are the first two sets in the file),
identify all the special sum sets, A1, A2, ..., Ak, and find the value of S(A1)
+ S(A2) + ... + S(Ak).

NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 106.

0. Notation
===========

    - Capital letters designate sets of positive integers
    - The cardinal of a set is designated by the corresponding Greek letters,
      e.g. α = #A
    - a(1), ..., a(α) are the elements of A in increasing order
    - A(i..j) with i≤j is the subset {a(i), ..., a(j)}
    - n+A is the set obtained by adding the integer n to each element of A
    - SSS(A) means that "A is a Special Sum Set"
    - ΣA is the sum of all elements of the set A.
    - If the set A we are talking about is unambiguous, the we write Σ for ΣA
      and Σ(p..q) for ΣA(p..q).

                  
1. Preliminary remarks
======================

1)  C2 implies C1 as soon as β ≠ γ. So, in practice we can replace (C1)-(C2) by
      
        SSS(A) iif  | β = γ ==> Σ(B) ≠ Σ(C)                             (C3a)
                    | β < γ ==> Σ(B) < Σ(C)                             (C3b)
                                           
2)  The empty set, any singleton and set of two elements are trivially SSS:
        α ≤ 2 ==> SSS(A)                                                (1)

3)  If A is a SSS, then all its subsets are also SSS: 
        SSS(A) ==> SSS(B) for all B ⊂ A                                (2)
    

4)  However, all proper subsets of A being SSS does not imply SSS(A). Indeed,
    then any set of 3 elements would be SSS, and thus all sets with 4 elements,
    and so one so that any set would be SSS.

5)  Let b any positive integer. Then if A is a SSS,  
        a) {b+a(1), ..., b+a(α)} is also a SSS
        b) {b a(1), ..., b a(α)} is also a SSS
    Note that 5a) doesn't hold if b is negative even if 0 < b+a(1).


2. Checking if a set is SSS or not
==================================

For A to be SSS, all its subsets must be SSS. Therefore, a possible approach is
to check that all sets obtained be removing one single element of A are SSS. Applying this recursively, all subsets will be checked.

Suppose that it is the case, we still have to check that A is an SSS. However,
we have only to consider the cases where α = β + γ in (C3), as the other
cases (i.e. α > β + c) are covered by the subsets of A.

We split the discussion according the parity of α.


2.1. α odd
---------- 

Let α := 2n+1

Because its cardinal is odd, it is not possible to split A in two subsets B and
C of equal cardinal. Therefore thus β < c. So, the condition (C3a) doesn't lead
to new conditions in addition to those of the subsets of A.

Concerning (C3b), for any pair of subsets B and C such that β < γ with α =
β + γ, it comes β ≤ n < n+1 ≤ c. This invites us to define

    B := A(n+2..2n+1} (==> β=n) 
    C := A(1..n+1) (==> γ=n+1)

ΣB < ΣC must hold if SSS(A).

Obviously ΣB is the S-maximum for all subsets with at most n elements, and ΣC is
the S-minimum for all subsets with at least n+1 elements. Therefore the
inequality (C3b) holds for any partition of A in two subsets.
        
Conclusion: if all subsets of A obtained by removing a single element of A are
SSSs and if ΣA(n+2, α) < ΣA(1, n+1), then A is a SSS.


2.1. α even
----------- 

Let α := 2n

Contrary to the previous case, it is now possible to partition A into two
subsets of equal cardinal n. Therefore it is necessary to check (C3a) each pair
of sets of cardinal n. This problem is a variant of the "partition problem" [1],
which is of the NP-class. However, contrary to the general case, two additional
constraints holds:
    
    1.  The two subsets must be of same size.
    2.  We are not talking about multi-sets but sets, i.e. integers are present
        at most one time.

Nevertheless, it looks like this problem is also NP. Algorithms can be devised
to attempt to reach ΣB = ΣC efficiently. However they can't bring a negative
answer: not terminating with two subsets B and C such that ΣB = ΣC doesn't
mean that such a partition doesn't exist. Therefore in that case it is necessary
to explore all possibilities. Of course, the algorithm should be designed to stop exploring a case as soon as it is clear that it is either a SSS or it can't be SSS any more.

Concerning (C3b), all pairs of disjoint subsets (B, C) with β < γ implies that
β+γ < α. So, the condition (C3b) doesn't lead to new conditions in addition to
those of the subsets of A.

Conclusion: if all subsets all subsets of A obtained by removing a single
element of A are SSSs and if (C2a) holds for all pairs of disjoint subsets (B,
C) with β=γ=n, then A is a SSS.

3. Bounds
=========

3.1. First and last item
------------------------

In this section we provide bounds for the first and the last elements of a SSS A.

α=2n+1: Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+2..α)   ==> a(1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(2..n+1)
                                    a(α) < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+2..α-1)

α=2n:   Σ(1..n) > Σ(n+2..α)     ==> a(1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(2..n) 
                                    a(α) < Σ(1..n)   - Σ(n+2..α-1)

It is interesting to note that, the first two elements define a upper bound for
the last one: a(α) < a(1) + a(2).


3.2. Minimal value of the added element in first place
------------------------------------------------------

In exercise 103, a new SSS B is built from the SSS A by adding b as first
element and adding that same b to each element of A, to get A' = {b} U (b+A).
Let check how large b must be.

α=2n:   b + Σ(1..n) + bn > Σ(n+1..α) + bn   ==> b > Σ(n+1..α) - Σ(1..n)
α=2n+1: b + Σ(1..n) + bn > Σ(n+2..α) + bn   ==> b > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)

Let us consider the element in the middle of the range:

α=2n+1: Σ(1..n) + a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α)        ==> a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)
α=2n:   Σ(1..n) + a(n) > Σ(n+2..α)          ==> a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)

=> By choosing that element, the relation for b are fulfilled and a new SSS A' is generated from A, as stated in exercise 103.
