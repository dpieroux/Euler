Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:

    S(B) /= S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.             (C1)
    If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).                (C2)

For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not α special sum set because
65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159, 161, 139,
158} satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair combinations and S(A) =
1286.

NOTE: This is related to Problem 103, 105 and 106.

0. Notation
===========

    - Capital letters designate sets of positive integers
    - The cardinal of a set is designated by the corresponding Greek letters,
      e.g. α = #A
    - a(1), ..., a(α) are the elements of A in increasing order
    - A(i..j) with i≤j is the subset {a(i), ..., a(j)}
    - n+A is the set obtained by adding the integer n to each element of A
    - SSS(A) means that "A is a Special Sum Set"
    - ΣA is the sum of all elements of the set A.
    - If the set A we are talking about is unambiguous, the we write Σ for ΣA
      and Σ(p..q) for ΣA(p..q).

                  
1. Preliminary remarks
======================

1)  C2 implies C1 as soon as β ≠ γ. So, in practice we can replace (C1)-(C2) by
      
        SSS(A) iif  | β = γ ==> Σ(B) ≠ Σ(C)                             (C3a)
                    | β < γ ==> Σ(B) < Σ(C)                             (C3b)
                                           
2)  The empty set, any singleton and set of two elements are trivially SSS:
        α ≤ 2 ==> SSS(A)                                                (1)

3)  If A is a SSS, then all its subsets are also SSS: 
        SSS(A) ==> SSS(B) for all B ⊂ A                                (2)
    

4)  However, all proper subsets of A being SSS does not imply SSS(A). Indeed,
    then any set of 3 elements would be SSS, and thus all sets with 4 elements,
    and so one so that any set would be SSS.

5)  Let b any positive integer. Then if A is a SSS,  
        a) {b+a(1), ..., b+a(α)} is also a SSS
        b) {b a(1), ..., b a(α)} is also a SSS
    Note that 5a) doesn't hold if b is negative even if 0 < b+a(1).


2. Checking if a set is SSS or not
==================================

For A to be SSS, all its subsets must be SSS. Therefore, a possible approach is
to check that all sets obtained be removing one single element of A are SSS.
Applying this recursively, all subsets will be checked.

Suppose that it is the case, we still have to check that A is an SSS. However,
we have only to consider the cases where α = β + γ in (C3), as the other
cases (i.e. α > β + c) are covered by the subsets of A.

We split the discussion according the parity of α.


2.1. α odd
---------- 

Let α := 2n+1

Because its cardinal is odd, it is not possible to split A in two subsets B and
C of equal cardinal. Therefore thus β < c. So, the condition (C3a) doesn't lead
to new conditions in addition to those of the subsets of A.

Concerning (C3b), for any pair of subsets B and C such that β < γ with α =
β + γ, it comes β ≤ n < n+1 ≤ c. This invites us to define

    B := A(n+2..2n+1} (==> β=n) 
    C := A(1..n+1) (==> γ=n+1)

ΣB < ΣC must hold if SSS(A).

Obviously ΣB is the S-maximum for all subsets with at most n elements, and ΣC is
the S-minimum for all subsets with at least n+1 elements. Therefore the
inequality (C3b) holds for any partition of A in two subsets.
        
Conclusion: if all subsets of A obtained by removing a single element of A are
SSSs and if ΣA(n+2, α) < ΣA(1, n+1), then A is a SSS.


2.1. α even
----------- 

Let α := 2n

Contrary to the previous case, it is now possible to partition A into two
subsets of equal cardinal n. 

If ΣA is odd, it is obviously not possible to partition it in two subsets B and
C of equal sum (since ΣA = ΣB + ΣC, if ΣB = ΣC then ΣA must be even).

Therefore it is only necessary to check (C3a) for each pair of sets of cardinal
n if ΣA is odd. This problem is a variant of the "partition problem" [1],which
is of the NP-class. However, contrary to the general case, two additional
constraints holds:
    
    1.  The two subsets must be of same size.
    2.  We are not talking about multi-sets but sets, i.e. integers are present
        at most one time.

Nevertheless, it looks like this problem is also NP. Algorithms can be devised
to attempt to reach ΣB = ΣC efficiently. However they can't bring a negative
answer: not terminating with two subsets B and C such that ΣB = ΣC doesn't mean
that such a partition doesn't exist. Therefore in that case it is necessary to
explore all possibilities. Of course, the algorithm should be designed to stop
exploring a case as soon as it is clear that it is either a SSS or it can't be
SSS any more.

Concerning (C3b), all pairs of disjoint subsets (B, C) with β < γ implies that
β+γ < α. So, the condition (C3b) doesn't lead to new conditions in addition to
those of the subsets of A.

Conclusion: if all subsets all subsets of A obtained by removing a single
element of A are SSSs and if (C2a) holds for all pairs of disjoint subsets (B,
C) with β=γ=n, then A is a SSS.

3. Bounds
=========

3.1. First and last item
------------------------

In this section we provide bounds for the first and the last elements of a SSS
A.

α=2n+1: Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+2..α)   ==> a(1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(2..n+1)
                                    a(α) < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+2..α-1)

α=2n:   Σ(1..n) > Σ(n+2..α)     ==> a(1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(2..n) 
                                    a(α) < Σ(1..n)   - Σ(n+2..α-1)

These two equations can be rewritten more generally as
    a(1) > Σ(α/2+2 .. α) - Σ(2 .. (α+1)/2)
    a(α) < Σ(1 .. (α+1)/2) - Σ (α/2+2 .. α-1)


It is interesting to note that, the first two elements define a upper bound for
the last one: a(α) < a(1) + a(2).



3.2. Minimal value of the added element at the beginning
--------------------------------------------------------

In exercise 103, a new SSS B is built from the SSS A by adding b as first
element and adding that same b to each element of A, to get A' = {b} U (b+A).
Let check how large b must be.

α=2n:   b + Σ(1..n) + bn > Σ(n+1..α) + bn   ==> b > Σ(n+1..α) - Σ(1..n)
α=2n+1: b + Σ(1..n) + bn > Σ(n+2..α) + bn   ==> b > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)

Let us consider the element in the middle of the range:

α=2n+1: Σ(1..n) + a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α)        ==> a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)
α=2n:   Σ(1..n) + a(n) > Σ(n+2..α)          ==> a(n+1) > Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n)

=> By choosing that element, the relation for b are fulfilled and a new SSS A'
is generated from A, as stated in exercise 103.


3.2. Bounds for adding a new greatest element b to a set A
----------------------------------------------------------

a) α=2n

Σ(1..n) + b > Σ(n+1..α) ==> Σ(n+1..α) - Σ(1..n) < b
Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+2..α) + b ==> b < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+2..α)

==> a(n+1) - X <= b <= a(n+1) + X with X := Σ(1..n) - Σ(n+2..α) - 1


b) α=2n+1

Σ(1..n) + b > Σ(n+2..α)   ==> Σ(n+2..α) - Σ(1..n) < b
Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+3..α) + b ==> b < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+3..α) 

==> a(n+2) - X <= b <= a(n+1) + X with X := Σ(1..n) - Σ(n+3..α) - 1


4. Adding a new element at the end of an SSS
============================================

Here we assume that we have an SSS A and we attempt to extend it by adding an
element x at the end (i.e. x > all elements of A).

4.1. Rule C3b
-------------

4.1.1 α = 2n
............

The subset under study, [a(1), .., a(2n), x], has 2n+1 elements. 

The worst case is obtained by selecting the n+1 smallest item of A on the one
side, and the n-1 largest items of A and the new element x on the other side:
    
    Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+2..2n) + x 
    ==> a(2n) < x < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+2..2n)                              (C4)

But what about adding b to the subset of A?


4.1.1.a Let's remove a(i) from A, with i <= n+1 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

We are left with 2n elements, x included. So the worst case is obtained by
taking the n+1 smallest elements of A excepted a(i) (=> n elements) on the one
side, and the n-2 largest elements of A and x on the other side (=> n-1
elements). For this set to be an SSS, it is necessary that
    
    Σ(1..n+1) - a(i) > Σ(n+3..2n) + x 
    Σ(1..n+1) + [a(n+2)-a(i)] > Σ(n+2..2n) + x

With (C4) and because [a(n+2)- a(i)] > 0, that condition holds.


4.1.1.b Let's remove a(i) from A, with i >= n+2
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We are left with 2n elements, x included. So the worst case is obtained by
taking the n smallest elements of A on the one side, and the largest n-1
elements of A excluded a(i) and x on the other side. For this set to be an SSS, it is necessary
that

    Σ(1..n) > Σ(n+2..2n) - a(i) + x
    Σ(1..n+1) + [a(i)-a(n+1)] > Σ(n+2..2n) + x

Here again, (C4) and [a(n+2)- a(i)] > 0, implies that the condition is
fulfilled.

4.1.1 α = 2n+1
..............

The subset under study, [a(1), .., a(2n+1), x], has 2n+2 elements. 

The worst case is obtained by selecting the n+1 smallest item of A on the one
side of A on the one side, and the n-1 largest items and the new element x on
the other side:
    
    Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+3..2n+1) + x 
    ==> a(2n+1) < x < Σ(1..n+1) - Σ(n+3..2n+1)                          (C5)

But what about adding b to the subset of A?


4.1.1.a Let's remove a(i) from A, with i <= n+1 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

We are left with 2n+1 elements, x included. So the worst case is obtained by
taking the n+2 smallest elements of A excepted a(i) (=> n+1 elements) on the one
side, and the n-1 largest elements of A and x on the other side (=> n elements).
For this set to be an SSS, it is necessary that
    
    Σ(1..n+2) - a(i) > Σ(n+3..2n+1) + x 
    Σ(1..n+1) + [a(n+2)-a(i)] > Σ(n+2..2n+1) + x

That condition holds because of (C5) and [a(n+2) - a(i)] > 0. 


4.1.1.b Let's remove a(i) from A, with i >= n+2
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We are left with 2n+1 elements, x included. So the worst case is obtained by
taking the n+1 smallest elements of A on the one side, and the largest n
elements of A excluded a(i) (=> n-1 elements) and x on the other side. For this
set to be an SSS, it is necessary that

    Σ(1..n+1) > Σ(n+2..2n+1) - a(i) + x
    Σ(1..n+1) + [a(i)-a(n+2)] > Σ(n+3..2n+1) + x

That condition holds because of (C5) and [a(i) - a(n+2)] >= 0.


4.1 - CONCLUSION: if C3b is fulfilled after the addition of an new greatest
element, it will hold for all subsets of the original set, augmented by x.
